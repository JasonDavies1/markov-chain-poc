# Markov Chains 
I've known about the concept of Markov chains for a little while now and over the Christmas period 
I'd like to try and make a web app that demonstrates how this concept works. 

# Idea
Input some text into a "chat" application and feed the app words. Eventually, 
once I've given it sufficient input, the app should be able to generate a meaningful response. 

This in no way demonstrates artificial intelligence or machine learning, I'm just
trying to use a statistic to get something to talk to me. 

# Other things 
I'll need to think about how I store the results from one run to another. I don't particularly want 
to tell this thing to say "Hello Jason" over and over and over again. 

Due to the lack of intelligence, the application won't be able to answer questions, 
bang goes my chances of any form of meaningful debate with a computer.
